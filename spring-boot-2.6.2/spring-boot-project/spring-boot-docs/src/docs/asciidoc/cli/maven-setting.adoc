== Configuring the CLI with settings.xml
The Spring Boot CLI uses Aether, Maven's dependency resolution engine, to resolve dependencies.
The CLI makes use of the Maven configuration found in `~/.m2/settings.xml` to configure Aether.
The following configuration settings are honored by the CLI:

* Offline
* Mirrors
* Servers
* Proxies
* Profiles
** Activation
** Repositories
* Active profiles

See https://maven.apache.org/settings.html[Maven's settings documentation] for further information.
